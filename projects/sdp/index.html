            At around the same time, I, along with Jacob Magallanes and Murman
            Gurgenidze, was tasked by Prof. Tina Kahniashvili to reproduce the
            results of

            spent the majority of the summer to this end, and it wasn’t until
            mid-October that I had finally reproduced the significant results
            from the two papers that we were ready to move on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prof. Kahniashvili had originally intended to use the NANOGrav 15 yr
            data (which we will refer to as NG15 to match our paper) to
            constrain the graviton mass, but to our surprise, two papers had
            already been published that did exactly this with the NANOGrav 15 yr
            results,
            <a

            something no one had previously tried to connect with NG15. And
            thus, on October 17, 2023 at precisely 21:33 EST, I began writing
            the paper that we wanted to put out as soon as we could.

          <h2 id="gravitational-wave-background">
            Gravitational Wave Background
          </h2>
          <p>
            What is a gravitational wave background? To even address this
            question, we must build up our intuition of gravitational waves.
            Gravity, one of the fundamental forces of nature that may or may not
            have a quantum field theoretic description, acts on any massive or
            energetic body. In order for the gravitational field to update with
            changes in the mass and energy distribution within spacetime, the
            information must be carried via some sort of messenger, much like in
            the case of the electromagnetic (EM) field. Whereas photons/EM waves
            are what update the EM field, gravitons/gravitational waves (GWs)
            update the gravitational field.
          </p>
          <h2 id="gravitational-waves">Gravitational Waves</h2>
          <p>
            GWs are produced by accelerating mass/energy distributions, much
            like how light is produced by accelerating charges. They are ripples
            in spacetime, allowing for two modes of polarization, the “plus” (+)
            and “cross” modes (\(\times\))

            particles. On the left is the plus mode of GW polarization, and on
            the right is the cross mode of GW polarization. In GR, there are
            only 2 propogating modes of freedom, but other alternates to GR may
            have more.
          </div>
          <p>
            GW waves propogating by stretching and squeezing spacetime itself in
            perpendicular directions. There are three general categories of
            polarizations: scalar, vector, and tensor polarizations. They differ
            in the way they distort the spacetime and the direction they are
            allowed to propogate. According to GR, only tensor perturbations, of
            which there are two, can exist and the other modes are forbidden.
            Any observation that detects other modes would show that there more
            to gravity than GR.
          </p>
          <h2 id="first-detection">First Detection</h2>
          <p>
            GWs were first detected in September 14, 2015, almost exactly a
            century after they were first predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916
            through his theory of general relativity (GR), by the Laser
            Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors at
            Hanford, Washington and Livingston, Louisiana. These detectors have
            two 4 km arms arranged perpendicularly to each other and they use
            laser interferometry to detect changes in distances in spacetime to
            less than \(10^{-5}\) of the width of a proton.

            neutron star mergers have been detected by the combined efforts of
            LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, the Italian and Japanese counterparts of
            LIGO respectively. Currently, the detectors have paused their run,
            and are under maintenance to improve the sensitivities, aiming to
            achieve observations of GWs every other day.

            So clearly, gravitational wave physics seems to be popping off.
            Where does NANOGrav fit in all of this? There was a proposal to use
            millisecond pulsars as a way of detecting GWs. They have extremely
            regular periods, and so can be treated as the ends of a galaxy-sized
            interferometer arm. An array of these pulsars would be able to
            detect very low-frequency gravitational waves, since the GWs
            perturbing these pulsars would have to have wavelengths on that
            scale. In 1983, Hellings and Downs predicted that a SGWB (stochastic
            because it would be caused by a random process) would produce a
            distinctive GW signature, specifically that of a quadrupole spatial
            correlation (<a

            within our galaxy (about 67 pulsars in total) since 2005. In June

            They give strong evidence for the detection of a SGWB for the first
            time, and this prompted researchers to provide an explanation for
            the background. The most commonly held source is inspiraling
            supermassive black hole binaries (SBHBs), which emit low-frequency
            gravitational radiation through their orbits. We think that the
            closest, most massive binaries emit continuous GWs which would lead
            to the dominant portion of the SGWB. However, there is most likely
            more to the story, since that expanation doesn’t entirely describe
            the signal we observe.

            Many different possible explanations that aren’t astrophysical in
            origin are proposed, summarized in the second paragraph of the
            introduction of my paper. To briefly recount, possible explanations,
            with the references suppressed since they are already enumerated in
            the paper, are cosmic strings, domain walls, first-order phase
            transitions in the early universe, primordial magnetic fields,
            primordial GWs, scalar-induced GWs generated by primordial black
            holes, and even a non-GW explanation for the background. These
            exhibit varying backgrounds in the frequency range of the
            observation, but they all can reproduce the signal to some extent.

            Due to our work with massive gravity, and considering the lack of
            literature that primarily uses massive gravity to explain the
            signal, we use it in conjunction with primordial GWs to explain
            NG15.

            Gravitational waves, and gravitons by extension, are typically
            thought of as massless, much like the photon. However, this doesn’t
            necessarily have to be true. If we allow the graviton to have a
            non-zero positive mass, then interesting behavior of the field
            emerge. Firstly, we note that any linear theory of MG suffers from
            the vDVZ discontinuity, ghost instabilities, and other issues. Many
            attempts have been made to address this and extend it to a
            non-linear theory. One successful way was done by the

            1/(a_r H_{\text{inf}})\). We assume \(a_r\) is fixed in this paper
            and that \(H_{\text{inf}}\) and \(\tau_r\) may vary. We tried to
            vary \(a_r\) at first, but it didn’t seem logical to fix the cutoff
            time but not the scale factor of inflation, which seems like more a

            decay is slower compared to the massless graviton’s mode decay, and
            so its final amplitude should be amplified or blue tilted compared
            to the massless graviton. Explicit expressions (in the superhorizon

            Firstly, we want to see if there’s any relvant quantity related to
            gravitational waves to look at. Luckily, there is such a quantity
            that is widely studied, specifically the energy density spectrum at
            the present time. This is a practical way that allows us to
            determine the influence of deviations of GR on the gravitational
            waves generated from inflation. There are various other quantities
            one could look at, like the power spectral density, characteristic
            strain, the amplitude of the gravitational waves, and many more.
            These quantities are all usually related to each other, with some
            constant factor multiplied by the frequency raised to another
            constant factor.

          <p>The energy density is defined as</p>
